## Overview - Triangular Peg Solitaire
Peg Solitaire is a single-player strategy puzzle game that challenges your spatial and logical reasoning skills. Despite its seemingly simple set-up and rules, the game has racked the brains and brought entertainment to many since the 17th century.

We have implemented the 15-holes triangle configuration of the Peg Solitaire game. The objective of the game is to eliminate pegs until there is only one peg left on the board. To remove pegs, you can jump over an adjacent peg into an empty hole, removing the adjacent peg.

With 6816 solutions to the game, our game breaks down the original Triangular Peg Solitaire game into 3 levels of increasing difficulty. While attempting level 1 (3 starting pegs) and level 2 (7 starting pegs), you can learn the rules of the game and come up with your own strategies. You will then progress to the full version of the game in level 3 (14 starting pegs).

3 colours are used to provide instant visual feedback. A blue light indicates remaining pegs, a green light indicates the peg currently selected, and a red light indicates the valid holes you can jump into. Unlit LEDs simply indicate a hole.
